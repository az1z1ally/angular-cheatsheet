<!-- 
The @for block in Angular is used to repeat an element in the DOM for each item in a collection

How the syntax work:
@for (item of items; track item) {
  #-- Content to be repeated 
}

item: Represents the current item in the iteration.
items: Refers to the collection or iterable to be iterated over (e.g., an array, string, etc.).
track: Denotes the identity to pass to each element.
The track expression is crucial because it provides a unique identity for each item. Angular uses this identity to optimize DOM operations when items are added, removed, or reordered. For simple cases, you can use track $index as a reasonable default12.

Additionally, inside the @for contents, several implicit variables are available:

$count: Number of items in the collection.
$index: Index of the current row.
$first: Indicates whether the current row is the first row.
$last: Indicates whether the current row is the last row.
$even: Indicates whether the current row index is even.
$odd: Indicates whether the current row index is odd.
You can also alias these variables using the let segment, especially when dealing with nested @for blocks where contextual variable names could collide1. For example:

@for (item of items; track item.id; let idx = $index, e = $even) {
  Item #{{ idx }}: {{ item.name }}
} -->
